#will make different 'make.conf' files to download from github according to answer
#It seems like the best way to do it instead to echoing to the same file over and over
#it's not like one NUC of the same make and model is going to differ

#will add option to choose. just getting basics down first

#There will be no ssh, telnet, tftp, or ftp the main way of transferring files would be rslsync {I got permission to use this software} 
#unless someone can give me a better idea of what to use, and if you do by all means open a ticket @ https://github.com/TheDurtch/funtoo-self-setup/issues and I will check over it
#But I need a detailed write up of why I should use that program and how it will be better then Resilio Sync

#Reason why I am using rslsync is it transfers things in chunks via torrent protocol with this you can add a bunch of music to your sync folder
#and it will send it to your NUC when ever both machines are on and connected to the Internet so you don't have to wait for it to sync
#e.g. if you are at Starbucks drive-thru or McD drive-thru, or if you are one of those lucky bastards who have Unlimited Data plans on your phone you could tether to it and sync then too
