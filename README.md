# funtoo-self-setup
init
A script to setup funtoo on Intel NUCs
It's right now a mostly secret project what this is for
I'll release the main purpose of these scripts when I get the hardware and finish the script
Will probably be more then just a script when I get done

Thinking about porting over to ~~dialog~~ whiptail for a GUI like experience
