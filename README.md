# funtoo-self-setup
init

Putting the coding on hold until I get hardware, I can use VMWare for a lot of it but since my Desktop has an AMD CPU and NUCs have Intel I can't tune the kernel and it's harder to setup
I just really need the hardware :P

Infact I am thinking about **__maybe__** switching to Arch but we'll see

---

A script to setup funtoo on Intel NUCs
It's right now a mostly secret project what this is for
I'll release the main purpose of these scripts when I get the hardware and finish the script
Will probably be more then just a script when I get done

Thinking about porting over to whiptail for a GUI like experience
